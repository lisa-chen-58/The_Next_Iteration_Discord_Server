# Q&A

**Does this allow you to manipulate the user class? In case you might wanna add something.**

- You can, but the best practice is the create another data model, you set a 1 to 1 relationship with a user in a profile
- You can go into the user data model and change it but it's not the recommended path

**Can you create a superuser at any time? like halfway through a project?**

- There should be at least one user.
- We can go in and create multiple super users.

**CSRF stands for cross site request forgery**

**For Stuart at the end:**

**Would you be willing for people to reach out to you on Discord?**

* Yes! Just reach out on Discord! **Stuart_Yee**#8850

- FYI
- It's advertisement in being an advocate.
- There is a Django tutorial.
- Alternative is to follow alone with their tutorial

**Why do you think people would choose to teach Flask over Django?**

* It's easy to define a model and it's relationships.
* Django takes care of a lot for you.
* On the other hand, if this is what you learned first, you wouldn't have a deeper understanding of what a framework is, what's happening, how data models work, etc.

**How long do you think it would've taken you to create this app normally?**

* If I had direction, 1 hour
* If it was similar real time realization, about 2 hours
* This presentation took me about 3 hours
